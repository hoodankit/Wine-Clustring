Problem Statement:-

This dataset is adapted from the Wine Data Set from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine by removing the information about the types of wine for unsupervised learning.
These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. 
The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines.

The attributes are:

Alcohol :- Percentage of alochol in wine
Malic acid :- Percentage of MAlic Acid in wine
Ash :- Percentage of residue left after evaporation of wine
Alcalinity of ash :- Sum of cations, other than the ammonium ion, combined with the organic acids in the wine
Magnesium :- Percentage of Magnesium in wine
Total phenols :- Total percentage of phenols in wine
Flavanoids :- Percentage of Flavanoids in wine
Nonflavanoid phenols :- Percentage of Nonflavanoid phenols
Proanthocyanins :- Explain bitterness and color of red wine changing over time
Color intensity :- Inensity of color
Hue :- Percentage of hue character
OD280/OD315 of diluted wines :- The greater OD280/OD315 absorbance ratio denotes high protein purity.
Proline :- Type of a amoni acid.


Note :- The code work is done in jupyter-notebook.
